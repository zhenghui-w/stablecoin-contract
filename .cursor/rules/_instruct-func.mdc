# FunC Smart Contract Development Guide

## FunC Language Basics

FunC is TON's smart contract language. Key syntax and conventions:

- Functions end with `;`
- Variables are declared with types: `int`, `slice`, `cell`, `builder`
- Include files with `#include "filename.fc"`. This depends on the relative file path.
- Booleans are defined by int. True is `-1` and false is `0`
- If you are writing code that does not seem clear on what it does at a glance, include a comment explaining the code.
- If you are not sure about FunC or TON, please refer to the online resources for reference.

## Contract Structure Pattern

Main contracts follow this pattern:
1. **Includes** - Import dependencies
2. **Storage Functions** - `load_data()` and `save_data()`
3. **Message Handlers** - `recv_internal()` for processing messages
4. **Getters** - Public read-only functions

## Important Files

- [`stdlib.fc`](mdc:contracts/stdlib.fc) - Standard library with message building utilities

## Common Patterns

- **Error Handling**: `throw_unless(error_code, condition)` 
- **Address Validation**: `equal_slices_bits(addr1, addr2)`
- **Message Building**: Use `begin_cell()` and `end_cell()`
- **Storage**: Use `get_data()` and `set_data()`
